## üì¶ Project Overview

This project implements a basic e-commerce platform using Clean Architecture principles and RESTful microservices. The system is composed of the following three main components:

1. **API Gateway** ‚Äì Handles request routing, logging, telemetry, and authentication.
2. **Inventory Service** ‚Äì Manages products, categories, stock levels, and prices.
3. **Order Service** ‚Äì Manages order creation, status updates, and payment handling.

Each service is a standalone Go (Golang) application using the Gin framework and PostgreSQL as the database.

## üèóÔ∏è Microservices & Architecture

All services are structured following Clean Architecture:
- `cmd/` ‚Äì Application entrypoint
- `internal/` ‚Äì Domain logic (usecases, entities, repositories, routes, handlers)
- `config/` ‚Äì Configuration and environment loading
- `db/` ‚Äì DB migrations and init scripts
- `Dockerfile` ‚Äì For building and running containers
